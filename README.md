# Roblox FLog Archive
Roblox FLog Archive is a small service to archive plaintext FLogs in the Roblox Player binary.

## Why though??

Roblox engineers sometimes add little easter eggs that get appended to your Roblox log files during client initialisation, I always enjoyed seeing them whilst inspecting my log files and have decided to start a archival program to keep a history of all `FLog`s found in the Player binary.
As a bonus, normal `FLog`s will not be excluded from being archived. (Because that would be too much work for my poor brain x3)

## Starting your own instance

Although I don't see why you would want to, but if you insist, see below!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to deploy this onto a Linux-based server, as the command used for extracting the FLogs from the binary is a Linux command.

### Requirements

- Node.js ([I recommend using NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
- NPM ([PnpM is recommended](https://pnpm.io/))
- A Linux-based server (I recommend any Debian-based distribution, such as [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server))

## FLogs that mention `CLIxxxxx`
ðŸ¤«

- `Hello from CLI72702`
- `Hello from CLI73184`

## Honorable mentions

- `Hello from your car's extended warranty!`
- `Hi rawr to author of CLI 72542`
- `Hello, it's builderman. I lost my wallet and need you to wire me a few hundred dollars.`
- `Hi! Ok, does venmo work?` (Probably a reply to the FLog above)
- `Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not.`
- `Hello everyone! Hope I'm doing this right`
- `WAZZZZUP`
- `Hello from your car's extended warranty!`
- `You are the next heir to the deceased king of Congo. Claim your prize today!`
- `When I get sad, I just stop being sad and be awesome instead!`
- `Hi, this is Alex! I am surprised if you are reading this, have a good day.`
